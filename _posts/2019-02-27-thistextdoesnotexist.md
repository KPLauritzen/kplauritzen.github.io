`TL;DR`: I stole a thing.

### Generating text for fun and profit

I stole samples from the recent OpenAI [language model](https://blog.openai.com/better-language-models/), generating text without human input. This continues the [excellent](http://www.thisairbnbdoesnotexist.com/) [work](https://www.thiswaifudoesnotexist.net/) [of](https://www.thispersondoesnotexist.com/) [many](https://thiscatdoesnotexist.com/) [others](https://github.com/paubric/awesome-doesnotexist).

Many thanks to [Peter Ericson](https://github.com/pgericson) for helping me bodge some javascript together for this project. I have absolutely no idea what I'm doing, so anything that remotely works is entirely Peters fault.

See the thing [here](http://kplauritzen.dk/thistextdoesnotexist/).
