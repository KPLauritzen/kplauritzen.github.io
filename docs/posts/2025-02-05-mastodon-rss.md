# How to follow Mastodon accounts using an RSS feed

I've been really happy with my self-hosted RSS reader [FreshRSS](https://freshrss.org/index.html) .
I've consolidated a lot of the newsletter spam and occasional checking of blogs with a more considered decision to go to the RSS reader.

This means that I have had less desire to check out whats going on on Mastodon.

I just found out that I can get an RSS feed for Mastodon accounts. So, if I wanted to follow [@charliemarsh](https://hachyderm.io/@charliermarsh) I can just append `.rss` to the url of his profile webpage. (Note, this has to be his [original page](https://fedi.tips/what-are-original-pages-in-mastodon/)).
So, Charlies original page is `https://hachyderm.io/@charliermarsh` and the RSS feed with all his public posts are available at `https://hachyderm.io/@charliermarsh.rss`.

I have started to follow a few Python people where I'm not aware of any blog to follow instead. Aside from Charlie Marsh, I also now follow:

- [Samuel Colvin](https://fosstodon.org/@samuelcolvin)
- [Sebastián Ramírez](https://fosstodon.org/@tiangolo)

I also have an account that I barely use at [@KPLauritzen](https://hachyderm.io/@kplauritzen) that you can follow.
